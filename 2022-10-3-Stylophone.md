## Current Status
In Progress

## Project Overview
This Project is about creating a stylophone using a TLC555 timer IC. There are 20 keys each associated with a distinct musical note. 
Every time the stylus touches a key frequency associated with that key is heard on the speaker.
There is also vibrato mode which when selected acts like sustain on pianos.

## Educational Value Added
This Project with help me learn:
1. How to design low frequency oscillators
2. How to a simple audio amplifier 
3. How to design PCB

## Tasks
1. Design a square wave generator using TLC555 that produces different frequencies with different resistor values.
2. Design an audio amplifier that drives the speaker.
3. Design a low-frequency sine wave generator for vibrato effect.
4. Power everything with a USB c connector.
