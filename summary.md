# Summary
This Project is about creating a stylophone using a TLC555 timer IC. There are 20 keys each associated with a distinct musical note. 
Every time the stylus touches a key frequency associated with that key is heard on the speaker.
There is also vibrato mode which when selected acts like sustain on pianos.
