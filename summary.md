# Summary
Stylophone is a musical instrument that contains 20 keys each associated with a distinct musical note. Every time the stylus touches a key frequency associated with that key is heard on the speaker. 
Stylophone can shfit the octace associated with a key, up or down with a flick of a switch. There is also vibrato mode which is basically modulating the frequency of each key to make it sound "alienish".
This Project aims to reverse engineering a stylophone using a modern TLC555 timer IC and a old Programable Unijunction Transistor. 
The resevred engineered version aims to included modern features like power using type C, low power consumtion while idle and under load, support for low impedance speaker, and rechargable battery. 
This project also serves to see which sounds better the digital version based on the 555 timer or the analog version based on PUT as the orginal stylophone.
